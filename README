This is a utility for generating CPPUNIT testcases for C++ files.
The program needs a header file as input, it will parse the classes 
in the header file and will generate CPPUNIT testcases for the functions in it.

Sample usage:

UnitTestGen.exe -f MyClass.h -o output_dir

The above command will parse the header file "MyClass.h" 
and would create the CPPUNIT testcases for the classes in 
it under the folder "output_dir"


Known Limitations:
==================
1. Template parsing is not implemented
2. Inner class parsing is not handled.
